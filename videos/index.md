SageMathCloud is by far the best way to use Sage for new users. To help you get things
sorted out there are many freely available video tutorials. Each is a short, focused
demonstration of how to do something useful with SMC.

### Videos by William Stein

To avoid becoming language-dependent these videos are silent. This is better for Sage's
global audience, and I like to pretend that Buster Keaton is the one moving the mouse.

### Videos by Theron Hitchman

(I will fill these in as they get made.) The following videos all focus on using
Sage through the SageMathCloud service.

* What is Sage?
* Managing Projects: create, rename, describe, search, hide, delete, re-establish, share
* Managing Files in a Project with the GUI: create, import, delete, rename, move, search
* Common file types in SMC: worksheets, terminals, LaTeX, pdf, iPython, tasks, markdown, code
* Using the terminal to manage files: `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `open`, `rm`, `ls`,
  `pwd`, `less`, `more`
* Sage as a Calculator
* Sage for linear algebra: vectors and matrix algebra
* Sage and _methods_: object-oriented syntax
* Sage and Python scripting
* Annotating Sage worksheets with html or markdown
* Printing from SMC
* SMC's chat feature
* Finding help: [tab]-completion, the `?` and `??` methods
