## What is Sage?

From the official [Sage Project Web Site]({{site.sageurl}}):

> Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL.
> It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.
>
> Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.

Sage has many convenient features:

- It is FREE and OPEN. Sage is free to use, free to modify, free to share.
- The cloud/notebook/worksheet system can be used in any (modern) browser, without installation.
- There is an active and helpful community of developers and users around the world.
- Sage makes extensive use of [Python]({{site.pythonurl}}), a powerful, easy-to-learn, and popular scripting language.

At some point, you might want to get your own copy of Sage and download it. But
for now, use the SageMathCloud (SMC) service at [{{site.smcurl}}]({{site.smcurl}}).
The cloud service is powerful and flexible, and let's you use Sage, Python, R, iPython, LaTeX, and more
through a web browser.
