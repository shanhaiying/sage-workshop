### Where do I get more instruction?

There are some good tutorials available.

* [From a group at San Diego State University](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~mosulliv/Courses/sdsu-sage-tutorial/index.html)

* [The official Sage project tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial)

* [The tutorial designed for an MAA PREP Workshop](http://sagemath.org/doc/prep/index.html).

* There is a shorter version of [the official tutorial with just highlights](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour.html?highlight)

* There are also "[Sage quick reference documents][quick]" for several subjects on the Sage Wiki. These are useful cheat sheets with frequently used commands, organized by subject.

[quick]: http://wiki.sagemath.org/quickref


You can also look through relevant documentation.

* There is the page for [all of the official Sage documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/index.html).

* [The Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/). Note that Sage uses Python 2.x as of the time this page was written.

And there a useful Q & A site:

* [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/questions/)
