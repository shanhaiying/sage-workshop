<center><h1>Sage Beginner's Workshop</h1></center>

<p>
This is an introduction to the basic functionality of Sage, with an emphasis on seeing how to handle a worksheet and how to get more detailed help. We will point out a little bit of the power that Sage has hiding in it, but this is <b>not</b> a full-fledged tutorial. Down at the bottom of the page you will find links to some more resources.
</p>

<hr />

Note that this worksheet is based upon an earlier one by Theron Hitchman. That worksheet, <a href="http://uni.sagenb.org/home/pub/0/">available here</a>, was designed for the Sage Notebook interface. This one is written with the SageMathCloud worksheet style in mind. Other contributors include: Harald Schilly, Gustav Delius.

<hr />

<h2>Worksheet Basics</h2>

The first thing to note is that a worksheet is made up of "cells." These are where you will do your programming. To evaluate a cell, you press [Shift]+[Enter]. Try it now in the cell below. Add 5 and 4.

Note that the output is marked by a grey parenthesis on the left near the line numbers, and the inputs are separated by thin, grey horizontal rulings. Also, the active cell has a light grey background cell.
</p>
<p>
Another way to evaluate a cell is to use the "run" button at the top of the worksheet. Depending on the width of your display, this button may or may not have the word "run" on it. If not, just look for the triangle pointing to the right.

Try that version now with the simple computation below.

To keep things rolling, you will often need to create new cells. At the end of a worksheet this is done automatically: there is always a set of blank lines at the bottom of a <i>.sagews</i> file. If you somehow manage to evaluate the last line, the page should refresh with a new blank line below the output.

The other way to make a new cell also works in the middle of a worksheet. Use your mouse or trackpad to hover over one of the thin grey horizontal rulings which separate cells. The ruling should get highlighted in blue. At this point, clicking the highlighted ruling will create a new cell directly below that ruling.

Try it now. Make a new cell between the ones below.

It is possible to delete input cells, too. To do so, simply empty the cell and press [Backspace] or [Delete] in the active, empty cell. Try deleting a one or two of the cells just below.

Note that pressing [Backspace] at the beginning of a cell will also remove the horizontal bar between cells. This joins the two input cells into a single one. That trick might be useful to you at some point.

It is useful to annotate your work by typing text right into the page. To do this, you can use two methods.

 + HTML: If you open a cell with the "decorator" <kbd>%html</kbd> as the first line, the worksheet will evaluate the rest of the cell by parsing it as html.

 + Markdown: If you open a cell with the "decorator" <kbd>%md</kbd> as the first line, the worksheet will evaluate that cell by interpreting the input following the Markdown specification, converting it to html, and displaying the html as output.

If you don't know either, basic [Markdown][md] is easy to learn. Even if you don't learn it, paragraphs typed in markdown will display roughly how you want them on this page.

After evaluation, the input for a Markdown or html cell will automatically hide. To reopen the input for editing, simply double click the displayed output. The text in this page has been generated with a mix of these two approaches, so you can double click them to see some examples of how this works.

Note that sage tries to remember what kind of object you are working with, so 4/5 is kept as a rational number in that form: 4/5. But if you give it a decimal expression, Sage will use finite precision arithmetic.

If you want to get a numerical (decimal) approximation to a number that is expressed differently, you can use the .n() method. This method has an option to change how many digits you want displayed. Here are some examples, all in a line. [This demonstrates how to get one compute cell to display several computations---separate them by semicolons.]

<h2>How do I get help?</h2>

<p>There are several methods for getting help while using a Sage worksheet. The most obvious one is to click the Help icon in the top left corner of the page. This takes you to the Sage documentation. Almost everything you want to know can be found there in one way or another. I say <i>almost</i> because Sage is an open-source project maintained by a community of mathematicians across teh world. Some people are better than others at writing documentation. Also, it is a bit intimidating that "Almost everything you ever need to know" is there! Sage is a large project with a lot of power and functionality. It can be difficult to find the thing you need unless you know how to look for it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Sage Developers have incorporated other ways to get help. The first option is called "Tab Completion." You can type part of a command and then hit the [Tab] key to get a menu of possible commands that start that way. Let's try it. In the next cell, type</p>
<p><kbd>A = ma</kbd></p>
<p>then hit the [Tab] key. After you are done looking, press [Escape] to leave the pop-up menu.</p>

There is a fundamental number attached to each matrix called its "rank." Sage has a way to compute the rank built in. Like most built-in methods, you can access this function in two ways. First type

<kbd>rank(A)</kbd>

and evaluate. Then make a new cell and type

<kbd>A.rank()</kbd>

and evaluate. Both times you should get the number 2 as output.

We have barely scratched the surface on Sage's capabilities. It is important to see that Sage can be made to deal with functions, it can solve equations, and it can make nice plots. I'll just put some examples of using Sage to do those things here.

It is important to see that Sage can be made to deal with functions, it can solve equations, and it can make nice plots. I&#8217;ll just put some examples of using Sage to do those things here.</p>\n\n<h4>Making a (mathematical) function and evaluating it.</h4>\n"}︡

Yes. We see that $f$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, $g'(x)$ is never zero. This is also apparent from the graph, too. Since $g$ is a quadratic polynomial, its two roots must come as a complex conjugate pair.

Of course, Sage has many ways of handling finding roots. Here is another one.

### What else might you like to know? ###

* Sage knows $\LaTeX{}$, so you can use that in Markdown or html cells. I did it with the mathematics above.
* Sage is built on Python, a wonderful programming language. You can use any Python code you want to do your mathematics. For example, I used some Python list comprehensions (which look a lot like set-builder notation) to make the following list.

## Where do I get more instruction? ##

There are some good tutorials available.

* [From a group at San Diego State University](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~mosulliv/Courses/sdsu-sage-tutorial/index.html)

* [The official Sage project Tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial)

* [The tutorial designed for an MAA PREP Workshop](http://sagemath.org/doc/prep/index.html).

* There is a shorter version of [the official tutorial with just highlights](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour.html?highlight)

* There are also "[Sage quick reference documents][quick]" for several subjects on the Sage Wiki. These are useful cheat sheets with frequently used commands, organized by subject.

[quick]: http://wiki.sagemath.org/quickref


You can also look through relevant documentation.

* There is the page for [all of the official Sage documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/index.html).

* [The Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/). Note that Sage uses Python 2.x for now.

And there a useful Q & A site:

* [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/questions/)
