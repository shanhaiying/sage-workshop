Now it is time to get some toys. The steps below will help you create a new
project and fill it with a collection of files (called a "repository") from the
hosting service [GitHub](http://github.com).

- From your home list of projects (which is currently empty!), press the "New Project" button.
  This will make a pop-up box asking for a title and description of you new project.
  You can fill these out however you like, as the fields can easily be changed later
  without consequence. When you have completed making a new project, it should now show
  up in your home list of projects.
- Click anywhere in the row describing your new project to open it.
- Your new project is empty, so there are no files displayed in the list in front of you.
- Now open a new tab in your browser and paste the following url into the address bar:  

      https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/9951941c-a526-4235-a3cf-8dcd24d14cc5/files/Materials/SageBeginnerTutorial.sagews

  This will open up a public (read-only) copy of a beginner's worksheet.
- Press the button labeled <kbd>copy to my project</kbd>. Follow the instructions
  in the pop-up window.

When you are done, you will have a functioning copy of a `.sagews` file in your
project.
