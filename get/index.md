Now it is time to get some toys. The steps below will help you create a new
project and fill it with a collection of files (called a "repository") from the
hosting service [GitHub](http://github.com).

- From your home list of projects (which is currently empty!), press the "New Project" button.
  This will make a pop-up box asking for a title and description of you new project.
  You can fill these out however you like, as the fields can easily be changed later
  without consequence. When you have completed making a new project, it should now show
  up in your home list of projects.
- Click anywhere in the row describing your new project to open it.
- Your new project is empty, so there are no files displayed in the list in front of you.
  Instead, you should see a link called "Create or Import a new..."
  Click it. The page will refresh to one with lots of options, including a big input
  box with a date-formatted file name highlighted in blue.
- Replace that file name with this:

      https://github.com/theronhitchman/sage-workshop.git

  and click the "from the internet" button. In a few seconds you will have a directory called
  `sage-workshop` in your project.
