\maketitle

Here is a paragraph. It has several sentences. This sentence has inline mathematics, in the standard way: \( e^x = \cos(x) + i \sin(x) \). This kind of thing looks nice.
It is also possible to display some mathematics.

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-n} = \int_0^1 x^{-x}\ dx
\]

By the way, that equation is \textbf{true}! It can be proved by looking at the MacLaurin series for $f(x) = e^x$, which happens to be absolutely and uniformly convergent on the entire real line.
