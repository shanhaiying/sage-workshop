#### Let's Make an Account

Follow the steps below to make a new account on SMC:

1. Open a **modern** web browser. Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome work best. Internet
   Explorer is generally not a good choice here, though I am told IE 11 works.
2. Navigate to the url [{{site.smcurl}}]({{site.smcurl}}).
3. Click the link "create an account" in the box on the right-hand side.
4. Fill out the form, check the box, and press the big button at the bottom of the page.

The official help page for SMC has instructions for making an account. From SMC,
click the button labelled <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>Help</button> in the upper left-hand
corner, then browse down to the heading for **Documentation** to find it. There is a link
to a video tutorial, too.



When you have finished making an account, your browser will refresh to show your
list of projects. This is your home. Right now, it is empty, because you haven't made any files.
We'll grab some starter files in the next step.

<div class="btn-group">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/get/">
<button type="button" class="btn-primary btn-lg">

</button>
</div>
</a>
