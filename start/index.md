#### Let's Make an Account

Follow the steps below to make a new account on SMC:

1. Open a **modern** web browswer. Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome work best. Internet
   Explorer is not a good choice here.
2. Navigate to the url [{{site.smcurl}}]({{site.smcurl}}).
3. Click the link "create an account" in the box on the right-hand side.
4. Fill out the form, check the box, and press the big button at the bottom of the page.

The official help page for SMC has instructions for making an account [is here][create].
Browse down to the heading for **Documentation** to find it. There is a link
to a video tutorial, too.

When you have finished making an account, your browswer will refresh to show your
list of projects. This is your home. Right now, it is empty, because you haven't made any files. We'll make one as the first
step in the tutorial.
