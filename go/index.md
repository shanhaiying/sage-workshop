title: A First Sage Worksheet
---

The shortest way to see how Sage works is to use it. The easiest way to use Sage
in the SageMathCloud is inside a `.sagews` worksheet file. To show off the basics,
you will want to play around with some simple commands.

- Click the files button at the upper left part of the page to see your directory structure.
- Click the `Materials` directory name, and then the filename `SageBeginnerTutorial.sagews`.
  This will open up a Sage worksheet.
- Work your way through this worksheet!
